## üëã Hello!

My name is Nathan, I‚Äôm from Chapec√≥/SC, Brazil, and I‚Äôm a developer with a strong curiosity for learning and evolving concepts and practices. I‚Äôve been studying software development since 2010 and have been working professionally in the field since 2013.

## üöÄ Activities

Currently, I work in the field of artificial intelligence at a startup that is not yet publicly disclosed. Our project involves applying and automating simple and complex processes using agents through LLMs.

I also have experience as a private tutor, where I‚Äôve taught and guided people from their very first steps as programmers to helping them seek opportunities in the development field. At the moment, this area is on standby, but I‚Äôm eager to return to teaching and bring more people into our professional environment.

I also have a strong interest in knowledge management‚Äîa relatively small but extremely important area in day-to-day business. I feel this field has huge potential, and I can see myself contributing to it through technology.

I stay very up-to-date with industry trends, always aiming to evolve my understanding of where the world is heading and applying it in our infinite space of solutions and growth.
